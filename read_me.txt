Demo documentation
================================================================

In each folder there is a read_me.txt file that describes what
the demo does and how to run the demo.

Additionally there is also a hardware.txt file that describes 
how all of the hardware features are wired for this specific
configuration.  This file will detail limitations and
configuraiton of this specific hardware, including required
jumper settings.  The hardware.txt file is not specific to the
demo.  The read_me.txt will describe what features it needs, 
for example the CS, AN, and INT pins.  The hardware.txt file
will describe what jumper settings and conflicts exist on 
several of the pins, including ones not used in this demo.  
Check the pins/features required for this demo in the read_me.txt
against the hardware.txt for settings specific to that
pin/feature.

Both of these files are attached to the project file and can be
located in the "Documentation" logical folder inside the
project.
